- Restructure css code with parent and child elements and less Id's and classes for less complicated code. 

- Finish the flexbox for the videos page, (make it look like it does in the wireframe.)

- Add more in depth content as well as a contact us function/page.

- Add more Favicons to the pages as fun features.

- Improve the quantity and quality of my commit messages. The commit messages where sort of shaky throughout my work and i will make them more consitent and better in my next project.
